# About me 🇧🇷

Hi, my name is Robson and I’m currently learning programming on a Data Science college degree in Brazil. My institution - Univesp -  is located on the brazilian state of São Paulo, but I live in Rio de Janeiro. That's possible since the classes are taken online.

I intend on using GitHub initially as a place to post code experiments and solutions to problems I will encounter through my course. Later on, I hope collaborating with others to solve complex problems...
