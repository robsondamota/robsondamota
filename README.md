# About me ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

Hi, my name is Robson and Iâ€™m currently learning programming on a Data Science college degree online here in Brazil.

My institution - Univesp -  is located on the state of SÃ£o Paulo, but I live in Rio de Janeiro, another Brazil state. That's possible since the classes are taken online.

I intend on using GitHub initially as a place to post code experiments and solutions to problems I will encounter through my course. Later on, I hope collaborating with others to solve complex problems...

Thanks for reading ðŸ™‚
