# About me ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Robson and Iâ€™m currently learning programming on a Data Science college degree here in Brazil. ðŸ™‚

My institution is named Univesp and is located in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, although I live in Rio de Janeiro, another Brasil state. 

I intend on using GitHub initially as a place to post code experiments and solutions to problems I will encounter through my course. Later on, I hope collaborating with others to solve complex problems...
